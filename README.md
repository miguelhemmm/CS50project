# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I divide my page in 4 sections

Home

Experience

About Me

Contact

In every page I added a navbar with all the hyperlinks to the sections, the navbar was made with bootstrap and its responsive, I use this approach because for the moment I donÂ´t know another way to do it (I can use angular to create this but was not the point in this project)

In the home section I added a bootstrap jumbotron and added some social media link which I sytled using Sass inheritance

In the experience section I added a carousel of different pictures with hyperlinks

In the about me section I just add a card that I made in photoshop, I adjusted the margins and with media I change those margins in smaller screens

in the contact section I added a dropdown which contains a contact me part, if we click on it we go to that section, which includes a table with my personal information and 3 cards which use bootstrap grid
